# Library

The library is available on the Redirect Web app, which provides various useful rules to the users.

You can see all the contents [here](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/tree/main/docs/library).

## Add Your Rules to Library

There are 2 options to add your rules to the library:

- **Pull Request**: You can send a pull request to the repository. To do that, you need to learn which files you should add to the repository. Please check [the instructions](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/blob/main/docs/library/README.md) for the details.
- **Forum**: Post your extension on [the forum](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/discussions/categories/redirect-rules) and request [the developer](https://github.com/mshibanami) to add your rule into the library. (Or, we could ask you from our side. ðŸ˜„) This may be an easier way than sending a pull request since you can leave it to us to add.

## Other Information

- We have an internal backend service that hosts the library contents. The app fetches the library contents from there.
