# FAQ

## Why should I allow the extension to read my information?

You may see an alert like this when you set up Redirect Web:

![](./assets/prepareExtensionPermissionAlert@3x.png ':size=200')

> This extension will be able to read and alter webpages and see your browsing history on this website. **This could include sensitive information, including passwords, phone numbers, and credit cards.**

This extension needs your permission to observe the page navigation to redirect to wherever you want to jump. So if you donâ€™t allow it, this extension can't work

Since we don't collect your personal information as per **[the privacy policy](./privacy-policy)**, we recommend you **always allow** it on **every website** for your convenience.

But itâ€™s not required. You can only allow it on specific websites. ðŸ‘Œ

## Why are the toggles of my redirect rules not changing or immediately reverting back?

**Edit (2023-09-01)**: We fixed this bug in version 5.0.0 for both iOS and macOS.

~~It's a bug. Sorry for the inconvenience. As a workaround, try changing the sorting order of one of your redirect rules and then restoring it to the previous order.~~

## Does Redirect Web inject ads or other unrelated content into websites?

No, it does not inject any such content. Only code that is necessary to provide the features described in this documentation and on the app page in the App Store is injected into websites on Safari.

It is possible that in the future, we may choose to show ads to users who have not unlocked the app, but these ads will only be displayed within the app or on this documentation, and not injected into websites.
