# Contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

## File structure

- `docs/`: A documentation of Redirect Web for Safari, which is hosted as [mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web](https://mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web/).
- `library/`: Data of the library available on the app, such as rules and categories.

### Documentation

#### Livereload

The documentation is powered by Docsify, and you can livereload it with their `docsify-cli`.
Please check [their repository](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli), and install it.

Once it's ready, run this command in the repository root:

```sh
$ docsify serve docs/
```

Livereload makes maintaining the documentation easier.

### Library

Please check [Library's README](./library/README.md).
