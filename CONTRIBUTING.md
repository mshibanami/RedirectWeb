## Livereload

This website is powered by Docsify, and you can livereload it with their `docsify-cli`.
Please check [their repository](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli), and install it.

Once it's ready, run this command in the repository root of redirect-web.

```sh
$ docsify serve docs/
```

Livereload makes maintaining the documentation easier.
